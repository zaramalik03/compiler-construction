This is a compiler written in C, including lexical analysis, parsing, grammars, semantic analysis, code generation and optimization. 
The main parts of a compiler are created. The lexical analyzer based on regular expressions that define the tokens are implemented in the Flex language.
The parser is implemented in Bison, based on a context-free grammar that defines the syntax of a given language.
There is a symbol table and an abstract syntax tree in the C language that is designed and implemented, generating code in GSTAL.

This was made for the Compiler Construction class (CS4223-01) taught by Dr. Bryan Crawley
